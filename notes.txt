to do:
  I5: get guess limiting working

  replace 'guesses' class variable with attr_accessor?

  styling: can a linked css file interpret erb?

  styling:
    -font
    -font-size
    -arrows
    form style
    button style



generate secret number
begin with 5 guesses
wait for input

take a guess
app runs 'check_guess'
guesses -= 1, then show remaining guesses






Rachel's help:
  get '/' do
    guess = params['guess']
    messages = if guess
      check_guess(guess.to_i, secret_number)
    else
      { "message" => "Welcome! Take a guess.", "background" => "white"}
    end
    erb :index, :locals => {:secret_number => secret_number,
                            :guesses       => @@guesses,
                            :messages      => messages }
  end
